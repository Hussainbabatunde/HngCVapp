# Create a Mobile CV Application

This project involved the development of a mobile CV application, which offers users the capability to create, view, and edit comprehensive CVs. The endeavor began with detailed planning and requirement gathering, followed by the design of an intuitive user interface. I adopted a cross-platform development approach to ensure accessibility on both iOS and Android devices using React native.
